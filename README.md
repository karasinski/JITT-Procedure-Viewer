# JITT-Procedure-Viewer

A fine, open source, and brittle expandable procedure viewer.

### Notes
- A subject can be shown the interface and interact with it for as long as they like without fear.
- Pressing the `w` key moves the marker up, pressing the `s` key moves the marker down.
- Procedures can be expanded/collapsed by using the markers on the left, or the buttons on the top.

### Experiment Instructions
- Once the subject is acquainted with the system, the experimenter should type a subject number into the input box (this subject name may not contain the letters `p` or `q`).
- The marker should be placed at the first step, and the subject should have the procedures to their custom level of expansion.
- The experimenter should press the `p` button, which will: a) Hide the top buttons for the duration of the experiment, and b) Not allow the subject to collapse the procedures, but _will_ allow the subject to expand them further.
- The subject should then use the `w` and `s` keys to move up and down through the procedures, which allows the experimenter to track the time at each step.
- When the subject is done, the experimenter should push the `q` button on the keyboard, which will save a file to the downloads folder.
- The file should be backed up.
